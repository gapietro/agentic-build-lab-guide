// so running it again never overwrites your original), then adds the lab's
// settings and keeps everything that was there. Lists (like "deny") are added
// to, never replaced. A setting that switches auto mode off is taken out (the
// backup keeps it). If your file isn't valid JSON, it stops and changes nothing.

// --restore puts back your backup exactly, or, if you had no file before the
// lab, takes the lab's settings out and keeps the rest. Once it has run, a
// second run changes nothing.
